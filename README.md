Introduction
This Java utility provides efficient methods for searching within arrays. Searching within arrays is a common operation in programming, and this utility aims to simplify and optimize the process for developers.

Features

Linear Search: Performs a sequential search through the array to find the target element.
Binary Search: Searches within a sorted array using the binary search algorithm, which is more efficient for large datasets.
Order-Agnostic Binary Search: Searches within an array regardless of whether it's sorted in ascending or descending order.

How to Use
To use this utility, follow these steps:

Download: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Setup: Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Integration: Include the ArraySearchUtility.java file in your Java project.

Linear Search
The linear search algorithm sequentially checks each element in the array until it finds the target element. This algorithm is simple but less efficient compared to binary search, especially for large arrays.

Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching within sorted arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty. Binary search is significantly faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.

Order-Agnostic Binary Search
Order-agnostic binary search is a variation of binary search that works on arrays regardless of whether they are sorted in ascending or descending order. It adapts the binary search algorithm to accommodate both scenarios, making it versatile for various types of datasets.
